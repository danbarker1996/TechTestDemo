Task 3 - Improvements to Code

1. Test code coverage is not 100%:

  - Only getAll and getByPostcode methods are tested in AddressService. Tests are needed for getById, create, update, delete and save.

2. REST controller tests don't cover failures for PUT, DELETE, and POST

3. REST controller needs better error reporting. ResponseEntity would be a good idea as this can house the body, status code and any potential error message.

4. Logging should be used throughout application to report when a request is received, process and succeeded/failed.

5. Possibly include a blacklist flag on the Address object itself, to save the need for a call to a separate call that creates another point of failure.

6. An endpoint could be created to add to the blacklist

7. Another endpoint could be created to get addresses by their town, in case the need arises to look up all the deliveries in a certain town.
